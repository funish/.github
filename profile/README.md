# Funish Project

> An open source project that aims to create a unified and standardised tool chain.

Funish is an open source project that aims to create a unified, standardised tool chain to reduce redundant development solutions, automate processes, lower the development threshold and provide more funding for the development of the open source community through commercialisation.

Note: All Funish projects may have unstable APIs until version number 1.0.0, use with caution!
